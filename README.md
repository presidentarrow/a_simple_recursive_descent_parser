This is not a completely adaptive program, meaning changing values of MAX and k will not initialize complete data set, as it is initialized manually. LOLz
This is what I've understood about knn.
1. have a training set, know the classes/category
2. get a point to predict its class
3. calculate the distance between that point and every point in the data set
4. select 'k' no. of the minimun distances
5. check the classes of the minimun distances
6. the class that occurs more no. of time i.e the class with highest frequency is the predicted class for given input
